# Shipment CRUD application

This is a simple react application that shows a list of shipment in a table. The application has feature of viewing details, updating, deleting a shipment. The application tries to fetch data from a [mock api](https://my.api.mockaroo.com/shipments.json?key=5e0b62d0), if fails then it takes the data from a local json file to populate the table.
